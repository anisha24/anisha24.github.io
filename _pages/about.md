I'm passionate about developing intelligent systems in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Network Automation. Currently working as a Software Engineer at Cisco Systems. My experience spans across image and video analytics and implementing ML-driven automation solutions. My work at Cisco has focused on creating intelligent observability platforms and LLM-powered dashboard generation systems. 

I pursued my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.

Previously, I've worked with C-DAC and DRDO, where I developed real-time systems for IoT and surveillance applications. I'm passionate about leveraging AI to solve complex real-world problems and creating scalable, automated solutions that drive technological advancement.
